# GreyTask

This repository contains the coding challenge for candidates applying for an Android role at Grey Finance.

Libraries used and things done:
- MVVM architecture
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit as http client
- Android Navigation Component navigation
- Coroutines Flow to handle network calls
- SQLDelight for offline storage
- JUnit and Mockito for testing
- Explicitly handled errors
- Offline mode handled

## Couldn't build the user details screen because I ran out of time but I already made the network calls and wrote the repository classes.
